### TODO: HW: Rewrite code, which will return only needed element of Fib sequence 
```fibonacci.py```

## 2. Zeros not for Heros
### Numbers ending with zeros are boring. They might be fun in your world, but not here. Get rid of them. Only the ending ones.
```zeros_not_for_heros.py```

- 1450 -> 145
- 960000 -> 96
- 1050 -> 105
- -1050 -> -105
- Zero alone is fine, don't worry about it. Poor guy anyway

## 3. Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.
### Given n, take the sum of the digits of n.
### If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced.
### This is only applicable to the natural numbers.
```sum_of_digits.py```

- 16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
- 942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
- 132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
- 493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2
